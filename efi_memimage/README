This code is incomplete and only works for 32-bit EFI.  It contains
the following pieces:

- EFI core library
- GNU EFI bootstrap/runtime relocation code
- standard C library code (from EFI development kit)
- BSD TCP/IP stack (from EFI development kit)
- BSD sockets library (from EFI development kit)
- hacked up TFTP library (stolen from U-BOOT, used for the VxWorks loader)
- VxWorks bootstrap loader (my own little experiment)
- Unfinished EFI scraper app framework

Note also that to build the EFI code, you need a version of binutils that's
targeted to produce EFI IA32 binaries (efi-app-ia32 backend). I think
Linux has this support in its native version of GCC/binutils by default,
but FreeBSD doesn't, so I had to build my own version of binutils. This
is not hard to do.
